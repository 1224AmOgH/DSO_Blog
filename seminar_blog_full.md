**Introduction** 

With the growth of smart telescopes capable of Electronically Assisted Astronomy (EAA), astronomy is becoming more accessible to hobbyists and the public. Yet, detecting faint galaxies, nebulae and clusters in light-polluted skies remains a persistent challenge. The paper _"Deep Sky Objects Detection with Deep Learning for Electronically Assisted Astronomy"_ by Parisot & Jaziri tackles this head-on—crafting deep learning (DL) solutions that help in real-time detection of celestial wonders. In this blog, we discover and explore a range of deep learning techniques developed for detecting Deep Sky Objects (DSOs) in images captured by smart telescopes and provide a glimpse into how each technique works and reflect on their possible real-world applications. 

**Background: From Eyepieces to Algorithms** 

Stargazing has long been a pursuit of patience and perseverance. Historically, even viewing well-known deep sky objects like the Andromeda Galaxy or Orion Nebula demanded clear skies, remote locations, and hours of manual setup. Observers had to contend with cold nights, light pollution and complex equipment—mounts, eyepieces, filters and tracking systems—all of which required expertise to operate. 

Enter Electronically Assisted Astronomy (EAA), this modern approach revolutionized astronomy by replacing the eyepiece with a digital sensor. EAA-enabled smart telescopes like Stellina and Vespera allow users to capture and stack images of nebulae and galaxies in real-time, even from urban settings. 

But despite this leap forward, a new problem emerged while smart telescopes produce stunning images, they do not tell you what you are looking at. For the untrained eye, a faint blur might be a galaxy or just noise. The task of identifying Deep Sky Objects (DSOs) within captured frames still requires astronomical knowledge or manual cross-referencing with star charts.
