# Introduction

With the growth of smart telescopes capable of Electronically Assisted Astronomy (EAA), astronomy is becoming more accessible to hobbyists and the public. Yet, detecting faint galaxies, nebulae and clusters in light-polluted skies remains a persistent challenge. The paper "Deep Sky Objects Detection with Deep Learning for Electronically Assisted Astronomy" by Parisot & Jaziri tackles this head-onâ€”crafting deep learning (DL) solutions that help in real-time detection of celestial wonders.
